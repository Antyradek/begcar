Rule

This program simulates CA treating rules as genes, mixing and mutating them in appriopriate way.
It's first purpose is to check, whetner this type of CA can be used in games.

Probably it all will end with chaos...

Structure of simulation file:
<width> <height> <mutation chance in promiles>
<rule count>
<capital letter character> = <rule with '/'>
<...rest of the rules>
<data grid - use '*' for dead cell>

Please NEVER EVER give incorrect file, or everything will blow up!
