Rule

This program simulates CA treating rules as genes, mixing and mutating them in appriopriate way.
It's first purpose is to check, whetner this type of CA can be used in games.

In most of the times, it all ends in chaos, but is nevertheless fun to watch.
Here we see for example as R-Pendomino (game of life 3/23) meets almost indestructible wall (/1234)

Structure of simulation file:
<width> <height> <mutation chance in promiles>
<rule count>
<capital letter character> = <rule with '/'>
<...rest of the rules>
<data grid - use '*' for dead cell>

Incorrect files should not blow up everything, but who knows...

Read manual for more info. Just "man ./begcar_man".
