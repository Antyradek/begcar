.SH NAME 
begcar - Breeding Evolutionary Genetic Cellular Automata Rule

.SH SYNOPSIS 
.B begcar 
.I file
.RI "[" "speed" 
=
.BR "200" "]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
Simulates life-like cellular automata with mixing rules upon birth.

.SH OPTIONS
.I file
.RS
Simulation file in the format given below.
.RE
.I speed
.RS
Speed of simulation (time between each step) in miliseconds. Default
.BR "200" ","
which gives 
.B 1/5
of second.
.RE

.SH STOPPING
This program works as infinite loop. To stop, use 
.B ^C

." The problem is, I can't make newline, so I use RS and RE

.SH VARIABLES
.I width
.RS
The width of simulation space
.RE
.I height
.RS
The height of simulation space
.RE
.I mutation_chance
.RS
Chance for each bit of rule to have random value. This number is in promiles (1/1000), and cannot be greater than 1000.
.RE
.I rule_letter
.RS
Capital letter used in data section to draw cells with that rule
.RE
.IB birth / survival
.RS
Characters in any order defining active bits of rule. In other words, as you simply write a rule. For example "3/23", which creates Conway's Game Of Life.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLES
Creates a 5x5 area with Conway's Game Of Life glider travelling bottom-left. At each move it has 1/1000 chance to mutate.
